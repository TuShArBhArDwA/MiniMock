## Technical Excellence and Privacy

Unlike traditional mockup generators that rely on bulky image editing software or ad-supported web interfaces, MiniMock offers a streamlined, professional experience:

- **Pixel-Perfect Realism**: Every platform is meticulously reverse-engineered to match authentic UI elements, including specific fonts, message tail geometry, and spacing.
- **Privacy by Design**: All data processing and image rendering occur locally in the user's browser. No conversations are uploaded to any server.
- **Mobile-First Experience**: The interface is fully responsive, featuring a native-app feel for editing and previewing mockups on mobile devices.
- **Watermark-Free Exports**: Generate and download professional-grade PNG images ready for presentations, portfolios, or content creation.
