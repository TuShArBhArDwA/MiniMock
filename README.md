> **Instant chat mockups. No data saved. No watermark. Easy to use.**

MiniMock is a fast, web-based generator that allows you to create pixel-perfect, fake chat screenshots for various popular messaging platforms. It features a live, responsive preview—what you configure on the left is exactly what you get on the right. 

Perfect for testing layouts, designing memes, or mocking up conversations for social media!


## Features

- **10+ Supported Platforms**: WhatsApp, Instagram, Discord, X (Twitter), Microsoft Teams, Slack, Snapchat, Telegram, Reddit, and LinkedIn.
- **Pixel-Perfect Realism**: Automatic adaptation to each platform's unique UI, including tail shapes, headers, footers, status bars, and font styles.
- **Direct Message & Group Chat**: Dynamic layouts shift realistically depending on whether you're configuring a 1-on-1 DM or a larger group chat.
- **Drag & Drop Messages**: Easily reorder conversation flows.
- **Customize Everything**: Add images to messages, change timestamps, mark read receipts (Delivered/Read/Sent), and swap senders with a click.
- **Appearance Settings**: Toggle dark mode, transparent backgrounds, phone frames, the iOS status bar, and time formats natively per-platform.
